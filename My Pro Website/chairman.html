    pyro-technique systems, integration and satellite launch service management during PSLV 
    continuation program till the launch of PSLV-C4. He conceived and executed the first time 
    launches of commercial mini satellites and developed small satellite mounting and separation 
    systems which have successfully deployed many commercial satellites in PSLV. He joined 
    GSLV Mk-III Project during 2003 in the initial phase itself and was the Deputy Project Director 
    responsible for overall design of the vehicle, mission design, structural design and integration.</p>

    development and qualification of CE20 cryogenic engine and the C25 stage which was successfully 
    flown in GSLV Mk-III D1 flight. The development of throttleable engines for lander craft of 
    Chanradrayaan-2 was another important development activity. First time successful flight 
    of 18mN thrust electric propulsion system in GSAT-9, development of 75mN and 300mN thrust
    Stationary Plasma thrusters were accomplished under his leadership.</p>

    <p style="padding: 20px; text-align: left;">He assumed the charge of Director, VSSC in January 2018.
         Under his leadership, VSSC has achieved significant feats like Crew Escape System demonstration
