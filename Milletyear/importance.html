        <p>International observances (day, weeks, years, or even decades) bring attention to the importance of
            a topic, Taguchi explains. Generally,a member nation makes a
            proposal to the UN through a relevant agency, such as the FAO in case of millets.</p>

        <br>

        <p>India's proposal to FAO went through internal approvals before being presented at
            the UN General Assembly and was approved with the support of 71 countries. India is the Chair,
            and Nigeria and ICRISAT are the Vice-Chair of the FAO International Committee for the
            International Year of Millets.</p>

        <br>

        <p>
            While this is a UN-wide event, because millets fall under food and agriculture, the FAO is the
            corresponding implementing agency coordinating with relevant technical experts, several UN member
            countries and representatives from all regions, and stakeholders such as academia, private sector,
            and civil society.

            The IYM2023 consolidates and pushes for global cooperation to promote millet in various ways.

        <p>
            As King points out, the seeds of IYM2023, were sown increasing research interest in neglected
            crops in the last century. Parallelly, the ICRISAT, ICAR, IIMR, MSSRF and other institutes have
            conducted research and development on millets for decades. The Indian government too started
            taking notice in the last few years, and rebranded millets as nutri-cereals in 2018.

        <br>
        <p>
            Even as area under millet cultivation dropped by 56% drop in India, production increased from 11.3
            to 15.3 million tonnes, Hughes points out. This was due to the development and adoption of improved
            varieties and hybrids, and better crop management practices. Overall, millet productivity has
            increased by more than two times, and pearl millet productivity has tripled.
