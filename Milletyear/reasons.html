        <p>One of the most famous food fads of recent times is quinoa, which rose to global
            fame as a superfood thanks in part to the International Year of Quinoa 2013 (IYQ2013).
            Quinoa too was a neglected and underutilised crop and was grown in 50 countries before 2013.
            After IYQ2013, this number grew to over 123 countries. This staple from the Andean region,
            is now grown in diverse climatic zones. Like millets, quinoa too is climate resilient,
            can improve nutritional security and an alternative to wheat and rice. However, experts have
            identified a boom and bust cycle when crops like quinoa rise into prominence suddenly.</p>

        <br>

        <p>
            King, who co-authored a research paper published in Global Food Security in 2022,
            says once economically developed nations learnt of quinoa's nutritional importance,
            there was a sudden increase in consumer demand triggering a rise in prices.
            There was rapid land-use change resulting in a production increase.
            This boom was followed by a bust, a rapid decrease in prices, and subsequently, production.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            In India, restaurants are serving millet dishes, mainstream brands such as Tata have a line
            of millet products under the brand called Soulfull, and several public sector canteens have
            started serving millets too.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            There was also a lot of pull-pressure on Andean communities to grow a certain white variety of
            quinoa, he says. There are over 6,000 quinoa varieties, but many brown and black varieties were
            neglected as the market prefers a certain colour and size. This influences breeding and growing
            preferences.

        <p>
            ‚ÄúIt is not the choice of the people who grow it, it is the choice of people who eat and trade in
            it,‚Äù he says. With millets, this can be fixed by focussing on diversity based on farm-based and
            community centric mechanisms.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúWe want countries to maintain their tradition and their production,‚Äù
            Taguchi emphasises, adding that with millets one of the important focus
            areas has been to understand diverse food cultures and traditions, genetic
            diversity of millets grown in specific environments, and ‚Äúto really celebrate
            those different types of millets and the ways in which they are used around the world.‚Äù
            Some ongoing programmes as part of IYM2023 is an ongoing global Chef's challenge to cook
            with millets to promote this.
