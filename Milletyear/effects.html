        <p>Satyavathi says that continued policy support is crucial, and so is more funding for
            research and development of various aspects including germ plasm research, productivity
            and storage, post-harvest technology and value-added products. The research and development
            scenario, as well as demand for and supply of millet products is improving.</p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Nutrihub, a startup incubator at IIMR, has supported over 500 entrepreneurs and companies to
            work on post-harvest technology, value-added millet products, among other things. ICRISAT,
            through the HarvestPlus-supported biofortification program, biofortified varieties of millets
            with high iron and zinc content.

            In India, restaurants are serving millet dishes, mainstream brands such as Tata have a line
            of millet products under the brand called Soulfull, and several public sector canteens have
            started serving millets too.

            King adds that several states like Karnataka and Odisha have promoted millets, many have
            included it in mid-day meals.

            Recently, the Indian embassy in China had a line up of events for diplomats to discuss and
            dine over millets, the Economic Times reported.

            As Taguchi says, in the long term, the hope is that there is enough interest from around the
            world, including governments and stakeholders to create a community of practice, research and
            development-focused groups.

            To avoid a repeat of what happened with quinoa, King says regardless of technological and
            production growth, the diversity farm and plates needs to come through community centric models.
            ‚ÄúThe fear is that a particular fashion of approaching this, in terms of promoting specific technology -
            whether it through seeds, processing facilities, or export strategy - should not kill the diversity on
            farms.‚Äù
